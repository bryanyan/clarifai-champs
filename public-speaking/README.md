CFP: Talk Proposal

### Building Web Applications with Flask

#### Abstract

In standard computer science curriculums today, we learn all these algorithms but we don’t learn how to create tangible applications. Flask is a popular Python 
microframework that makes it very easy to set up web applications. We’ll see what all those features actually mean, we’ll build a real deployable app, and you’ll be able to connect the algorithms learned in class to create real products.

Come learn how to save information, serve up different information, and make a blog. 


#### Description

This is an interactive workshop. We will be creating a simple blog with a few basic 
features. Participants in this workshop will first get a brief overview of what backend 
engineering is before we will learn how to make the blog. The talk will go over 
templating with Jinja, setting up forms, as well as user registration and login with a 
database. You’ll see how simple Flask is to set up and run and how much you can do with the basic programming knowledge you already have. You will get the most out of this talk with Python and Flask installed prior to the talk. It is recommended you have some basic programming knowledge beforehand; any introduction to computer science course is plenty enough.
